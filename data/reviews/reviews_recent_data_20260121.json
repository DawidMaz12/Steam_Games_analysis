Coming back to it now feels like opening an old memory that never aged. A true masterpiece and a permanent part of my collection.\r\n\r\nAlso… it’s the only game I can run right now because I sold my PC. Respect.",

The portal mechanic is really good as usual, with a lot of new really good puzzles. GLaDoS' personality is WAY better then the first one, as well as her design. and the big twist, was actually unexpected, and the final boss fight was actually pretty awesome.

        "review": "After over 3000 hours in Counter-Strike 2, and playing the series since childhood, starting with Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, I can honestly say CS2 is still one of the most intense and skill-demanding shooters out there. I waited a long time before writing this review because I wanted to actually experience the game properly before coming to any conclusion.\n\nCompared to more arcade-style or cartoony shooters like Valorant, CS2 feels brutally raw and unforgiving in the best way. Every round matters, every mistake gets punished, and those late-round bombsite fights can get absolutely brutal, chaotic, and intense. The tension and adrenaline you get in clutch moments is something I honestly haven’t felt in any other game.\n\nThe only serious downside right now is the anti-cheat. Cheaters are still too common and it really hurts the experience for honest players. Valve seriously needs to take this more seriously.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that competitive matchmaking can sometimes take a while, especially during off-peak hours or in certain regions. That’s not really Valve’s fault since it’s just a player-traffic thing, but it can still get a bit annoying when you just want to get into a game.\n\nEven with that issue, CS2 is still a legendary competitive game and easily one of the greatest FPS titles ever made.\n\nFür mich bleibt Counter-Strike das beste kompetitive FPS aller Zeiten.",

        "review": "The game is quite contradict. On one hand — VALVE has reputation of shipping well-detailed and overall quality products. Which this game definitely is. And what on the other hand... is definitely a dealbreaker for me.\r\n\r\n1. Premier and Competitive matches are badly unbalanced on player skill groups.\r\n\r\n2. Large % of cheaters. Some of them don't even try to hide it. What of it, since anti-cheat system doesn't work properly and the developer doesn't react?\r\n\r\n3. Hit registration degraded badly since CS:GO. You might hit someone with a shotgun multiple times point blank and it wouldn't register any single hit. Keeping in mind very low ping (10-20), as I mostly match on the servers in my location on very close.\r\n\r\nI'd add very toxic community here, even the adult one, but IMO it's quite common for multiplayer games.\r\n\r\nI like the gameplay and how detailed the game is — it is quite a unique experience. Though the cons above put large feces with flies and smell on that experience and VALVE doesn't do anything about it.",

Now, playing Counter Strike 2, I find myself furious and frustrated than having actual fun, the quality degraded massively in terms of the kind of players the game attracts. Counter Strike / Valve does absolutely nothing about the players who hack in this game. I recently bought Prime thinking the pool of players will improve but I couldn't be more wrong, I feel cheated of my money. There should be a basic responsibility of Valve towards their players, to ensure the gameplay is fair and hackers are actively detected and banned. It gets tougher for girl gamers especially considering they have to deal with degenerates in the game as well who have fragile egos and lack respectful communication skills. I would not recommend this game at this stage for people looking to have fun and not have their time ruined by sadistic players.",

And Valve takes 6-12 months from people start reporting users for BLATANT cheating until they're banned. \r\n\r\nSecond, there are problems where hits don't register. You can watch the replay, and clear hits are not registered or registered as minor damage. Like an AWP hit to what seems to be an earlobe only does slight damage, when it should be a headshot and instant kill.\r\n\r\nThird, in a lot of lobbies, especially deathmatch, there are lots of bots. I don't know if Valve's put them in there to inflate player numbers, or if people use them to farm cases. Nevertheless, it's a problem. If you spectate them, they'll freeze instantly and then disconnect after about 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nIs it still entertaining for me? Sure, because I've played CS on and off for 20 years. \r\n\r\nWould I recommend CS2 to new players in today's state? I'm afraid not.",

Love the fact the system is down for service and somehow theres still 15,000 people playing? yea cmon pubg stop scamming people. youre not fixing anything, you do the same thing over and over again to favour cheaters and the people who spend the most money on the game.",

        "review": "This is by far and away the best extraction shooter I've ever played. Embark did what Battlestate hasn't been able to achieve in 10 years, make a fun extraction shooter game. This game just oozes pure creativity and passion, and you can tell by the transparency and speed of the devs that they actually give a shit about the user experience. They have some really cool road maps for future additions to the game, and not just small chnages, game changing shit. They've already spoken out about their interests in adding a fully walkable hub where you can visit traders and interact with other players, as well as many more new ARC enemies. maps with bigger scales, new weapons, items and on and on. This game is an investment, and a cheap one at that. I have multiple friends who have never played extraction shooter games or any real punishing games in general who are absolutely hooked on this game less than 10 hours in. As someone with 300 hours and 130 topside, this game just gets even more fun the more you play and learn. The game is much more straightforward than your typical extraction shooter at the surface, but as you play more, you realize the depth of some of the mechanics and the variety of ways you can play. There's rats, opportunists, betrayers, PvE players, PvP players and everything inbetween. Most low level solo lobbies are filled with peaceful players which often leads to low level players working together to learn the game and start completing their early game objectives. This game is half the price of your average AAA game and is 1000x better than most.. If you haven't played this game already, seriously what are you waiting for? Get out there and blow some shit up.",

That said, there are a few issues that hold it back from being truly great.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is a glitch when matching with random players: you often can’t see their name tags, and sometimes your own team icons don’t appear on the map. That makes coordination confusing and honestly takes you out of the experience.\n\nAnother frustration is the excessive amount of bots sending friend requests. It’s annoying to sort through constant random add requests when all you want to do is play.\n\nOverall, Arc Raider is enjoyable and has a strong core loop, but it still needs some quality-of-life fixes to reach its full potential.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆",

Only stoic silence.\n\nFull game of half-baked things like in early access 0.1 but its full release version. Half of systems doesn't work and half doesn't have any sense.\n\nBut store rotation with the most ugliest skins ever seen in the game history works as clock.\n\nDevs have no future vision on this game and only head in the direction the wind blows.

Wait a few months to buy the game and see how it is then, but as of right now, its honestly not worth playing at all. Once they fix spawns, looting mechanics, etc, it will be worth it.",

Fun gameplay and interactions. The Arc learning over time is a great threat. Think Tarkov, but actually decent AI, and clearly discernable players vs AI, making for a way more simple learning curve, and hilarious PVP. I'm excited for the future of this game and i think its a nice nod to the player base that is tired of gambling on cosmetics, half assed art, and subpar or completely over done gameplay.",

The grind is enjoyable, risk v reward, and playable at your own pace.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of a learning curve as far as item value, crafting materials, what to recycle/sell, etc. but you pick up on it quick and it becomes a much faster process than when first starting the game.  There is a bit of a toxic community out there but they are few and far between. \r\n\r\nMy experience has been 95% positive/nice players that I've come across (especially in solos, duos/trios has a lot more PVP fighting from what I've seen).

Sadly Lately this game is filled to the brim with Rats who refuse to play fairly and will either sit in corners all game waiting for someone to pass,  sit in an extract killing people on sight or exploit out of the map to get a PvP advantage. What these rats do not consider is this toxic behavior will lead to this awesome game dying because it takes the joy entirely out of the game. I am all for PvP, but saying you are friendly and shooting someone in the back is so toxic it ruins the game. When this game first came back I witnessed so many people work together to tackle the harder enemies of the game, give each other free loot, and just general comradery among players. What happened to that? If you genuinely like this game, and wish to see it live a long life, consider not being a rat POS.",

        "review": "One of the buggiest gaming experiences I've had. Support is non-existent. I've lost count of the amount of times I've lost my inventory on extract or the game has crashed (both linux and windows, AMD or Intel and AMD or Nvidia, crashes just happen. 90% of the time if you can reconnect, you're dead and you inventory is gone. Matchmaking is supposed to be based on aggression to shleter the PvE players from the PvP sweats/rats. Spoiler alert: It doesn't really work. I haven't killed anybody in the game and yet frequently get lobbied with gronks who camp in the quest locations waiting to gank players while they are interacting with the objective. You can play passively and you'll still get cornholed by the type of scumbag who'd rifle through their mother's underwear, and fingerbang your cat when you're not looking. The co-operative playerbase seems to be dwindling and it seems like pretty soon it'll just be toxic rats. After they have nobody to screw over, I imagine the game will be abandoned. The voice chat is absolute trash, hardly works, cuts out every 3 seconds, is garbled, etc. The actual game balance is pretty bollocksed up too, time-to-kill on the PvP front is so short that you have very little opportunity to turn  the tables if you are (and you mostly will be) shot in the back. Exploits and cheaters are rampant. rare loot drop rates are painfully low. Hald of the skill perks have no effect, same with the weapon mods. Recently there;ve been random bans without explanation and no way of challenging them, (unless you're a streamer with enough followers that is) ... How this beta release masquerading as a retail-ready product won an award is baffling. Unless the decision to market an example of your lack of ability and Q.C. is deemed \"inovative\". Sadly it is not though, the amount of broken on release games in the last five years is pathetic. I've given this downloadable turd a fair chance, I've wanted to like it, and I see it has great potential. If I am to be completely honest, the thing that convinced me to leave a review was the abysmal support and disregard for the community feedback and issues. Save your money, save your time. If you're the type of gamer who'd play this as a PvP rat, who believes they can only \"win\" by making someone else lose, just go goon in your mother's dirty laundry, or better yet, sort your life out and maybe try not being a jaded P.O.S.",

The weather is dynamic and beautiful; the environmental design is pitch-perfect. The gameplay is solid, and it nails the extraction shooter: experience: looting, tense stealth, moments of panicked gunfire while you try to escape ARC and other raiders. Death is cruel: it feels absolutely terrible to lose a backpack full of awesome loot because you played your cards wrong, or because another player just wanted to wreck your day. But for every jerk wanting to steal your loot, there are other people, wanting to team up or even give you things. And there's no match for that feeling when escape the surface with a good haul. \r\n\r\nI originally picked up ARC raiders hoping it would replace the gap left by The Cycle Frontier. It didn't do that. Rather, it gave me something else: it gave me ARC Raiders. And ARC raiders is awesome.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this review, this game is a 10/10 for me.",

Plus how very non forgiving it is to players who can't play all day everyday in the aspect of how much it takes to do the wipes. Combine that with the PvP and its almost not enjoyable in any aspect. So unbelievably close to uninstalling this game.",

You mostly find friendly people, however if you kill someone be prepared to be called every slur imaginable.\r\n- GOOP GOOP GOOP\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Some of the spawns are very poorly placed, imagine you just fought off 3 teams only to get killed by another that spawned 100 feet from you late into the raid.\r\n- Spawning very late into a raid when you come kitted out, just to find nothing.\r\n- Cheating had become very rampant in the game, thankfully if you are killed by a cheater, you will get your gear back. \r\n- You will definitely get killed by extract campers\r\n\r\nOver all: \r\n- I can't stop playing this game.

How can we focus on the pve part of the game when there are idiots who kill for no reason?! I am not an aggressive player so there should be no reason to be in the same lobby as these people who just shoot on sight... embark please do something about this. Yes you guys clearly state that this game isn't pvp focused but yet here we are where people pvp to rob others shooting them in the back. I rather you guys make arc more harder rather than adding pvp to this game. my friends and i just want to loot, chat, take down arc and survive. PVP is so unnecessary, i dont care about the extra element of \"pressure\" from another raider... Just add more arc and make them more aggressive, i rather die to arc than a stupid raider who hops on to kill everyone on sight and ruins the damn vibe. Please Embark!",

        "review": "Excellent game. I appreciate that it's not some super realistic game with everything needing to be absolutely perfect. But it has great movement, great gun play, even the machines have learned to behave on their own via machine learning during development. The items in game all have great uses, most of the weapons have great uses, even the cheapest of weapons. \r\n\r\nI haven't played extraction shooters at all, the idea of losing progress just because I wasn't perfect in a game or getting jumped by a sneaky snake of a player setting you back days always turned me off of them. \r\n\r\nAggression based matchmaking puts you with like minded players, that of course won't mean you'll never encounter a RAT that jumped you and took your stuff. But even if they do, you can reload in with a totally FREE loadout, with some basic supplies, and a gun. If you return with the loadout, you can trade it in, for one of three specialized loadouts giving you different inventory space, equippable items, and even safe pockets so you don't lose that one awesome item you found while scavenging. \r\n\r\nYou even find blueprints, to make that one gun you love so much, silencer mods for your guns, magazine mods, stocks, foregrips, grenades, etc... So You never really get set back much, even more so if you intentionally go out with a basic loadout. I'd say give the game a try. I'm generally friendly, and have great player interaction.",

If there were a dedicated PvP mode that didn't involve randomly jumping out from behind a building to ambush someone who just wants to progress in the game, that'd be great.

None of the progression felt meaningful, at all.\n\nThe overall sound in the game is great.  Spatial audio is nothing that PUBG and others haven't already done.  I've never really reviewed a game on the basis of sound before... but that's about the only stand-out feature for me, I guess.",

Just A fair warning for others not fully aware of what this game is and what you will have to deal with. If you like being mad or get off on recking others game time for a buzz and a laugh, you've come to the right place.\nPVE/PVP? It's just PVP in the end. With none players trying to kill you as well. It's a fun game, but saying hello to someone and trying to just enjoy the game for what it is and getting shot in the back gets old really fast. I've meet a lot of other players In The game that were really friendly and cool, helping one another to finish the map. But the game puts you in a position to where you can not trust anyone around you if you are running a loadout or want to be sure to get out with your loot. If you're running a free loadout you don't worry as much but then you can't carry anything. They should have stuck with making this game a PVE OR PVP only game. Or even say PvP with PVE Elements. As you progress and try to go for higher end items to further your progression expect PVP when encountering other players. The loot is not shareable and others will be trying to kill you for it. All to make a gun you probably won't run because it cost you so much material to build, and you don't want to lose it so you'll use a free loadout LOL!\n",

        "review": "Easily the most monumental release of any extraction shooter; and unless you've been living under a rock, this game is extremely popular with all varieties of players that you will meet, befriend, backstab, jam out with, and/or die alongside. The aspect of playing with others while you avoid death by arc is what makes this game so dynamic and unpredictable, but a couple games where you are the victim of a greasy raider may be discouraging. If you play solos, chances are the lobbies will be helpful and passive. You never know what the next raid will bring, or what cinematic circumstance you will find yourself in. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, a combat game must have good combat. This game's movement and stamina maintenance during fights can sometimes feel as heavy or clumsy, but give yourself more time to learn and level your raider and you will soon feel like Jason Bourne. THE PVP IS GOOOOOOOD. THE SHOOTING IS GOOOOOOOD. The gun variance as of writing is fresh and all guns have their strengths and weaknesses, and will feel like endgame weapons when you level them up at one of your many crafting benches.\r\n\r\nthe feeling of winning a fight,\r\nthe feeling of losing a fight just to have arc kill your aggressor (let the trash talk commence)\r\nthe feeling of losing a fight to have someone come and save you, or you being the savior of someone else.\r\nthe feeling of killing a rat that tried to kill you at evac.\r\n\r\nMany of the games you will play have all of the above. Otherwise, you ight just chill with some raiders and hang out topside; aimlessly running around while having deep, thoughtful discussions with a stranger you just met 4 minutes ago. The game is what you make it until the arc or other raiders have other plans.\r\n\r\n10/10 would recommend to anyone. I have a lot of friends who never liked looter shooters or extraction shooters, yet haven't put this game down since launch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Its $40.......\r\n\r\n",

The world feels hostile and lived-in, like you’re scavenging through the aftermath of something big and unknowable. The ARC machines aren’t just enemies—they’re part of the lore, and every encounter reinforces that.\r\n\r\nPvP is where it really shines. Fights feel earned, unpredictable, and brutal without being spammy. No constant chaos, no gimmicks—just positioning, sound, timing, and nerve. Every player encounter gets your heart rate up because the stakes actually matter.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t a game that holds your hand. It respects your intelligence and rewards patience and awareness.\r\n\r\nIf you like extraction shooters with real tension, strong worldbuilding, and meaningful PvP, this one’s a no-brainer.",

Nerf the Items that are the most effective against ARC., Instead of, idk, making them a little more expensive to make/buy, but to throw it on the ground completely? seriously? This game IS NOT worth buying. Unless you want constant rats, people abusing command chat to respawn, wasting your time on people glitching through walls, and having a horrible time.

The world building is indeed beautiful, interesting, and works well for all of the activities we are doing.\n\nThere are so weird things, I can't seem to get the blue-plans to drop in a timely manner. Can go long stretches without getting one meaningful blue-plan. It's like the RNGesus is wired in a way to encourage us to spend more time in-game. This is fantastic for Steamcharts so it's going to look great in Excel charts when presenting to C-level execs and VCs--but paradoxically this makes for frustration for the people who actually pay for the game--no?\n\nThe frustration is two ways: 1) don't feel like our time and money is valued; 2) we can't try the builds and tricks that Youtubers are hyping about. \n\nI don't like to poo poo things, but this is so much of a thing I feel compelled. Oh well.\n\nIf this frustrates you, you can just do what I do, play some of the other hundred award-winning games in my Steam catalog. *shrug*. Vote with your wallet. Vote with your time. What else can we do?",

This is a nice breath of fresh air, with the matchmaking seemingly working correctly and putting m you in Lobbies that match your game play. I am pleasantly suprised at the spirit of cooperation and comradery. Players helping players even when not in a group. Hop in, avoid killing other players, and you too can enjoy fighting the machines.",

Off and on I've played a game called Vigor over the years and a few other ones, but this is one of my all time favorites. That being said, it's not for everyone. For a pvpve I feel its well put together, one of the maps Stella Montis has over all turned into a full on PVP area and more or less you'll be forced to get into firefights and such. If you have quests you have to get done there you're best bet is to try late night or early morning when there's minimal people loading in. But sometimes you'll get lucky and have a peaceful-ish run. All in all, highly recommend the game. It's worth the money and I'm having a blast, you may too.",

The retro feel, the PvE base with the constant stress someone could kill you for no reason - or a good reason, the assortment of enemies. I have 200+ hours played and I am not 1 shred bored with it. I highly recommend this game if you like surviving against all odds. whether its PvP or PvE or both, this game is great.",

Special shoutout to the anti-cheat, which doesn't respond to messages but simply closes the request. The developers are promising an update and optimization, and they're debugging it. I only expect Rust from the Chinese with a decent anti-cheat and optimization; these developers don't care. Advice to the developers: if they're reading this, have you heard of an anti-cheat on core levels? If not, research the issue here. A regular online shooter user is giving you a tip.",

Other bugs also include random camera angle glitches, lighting issues and alot more. I own FC 24 & FC 25 and i've never experienced something as bad as this where the game becomes literally unplayable.\n\nCannot even refund the game cause of the TOTY edition content, even though I haven't even played UT yet. Scummy move by EA so people cannot refund their buggy mess of a \"game\".",

For example a guy once quitted the match and got away with a win even tho it was 3-0 for me. Great EA. Secondary big problem is how much they want to milk the game for money as always, you can barely get some decent players without buying absurd amount of FC points. The matchmaking is trash and so are the sweats who play Ultimate Team. Save yourself some money, don't buy the game and enjoy life. This is absolute garbage",

I enjoyed it so much I made a save with each farm type and then bought it on PC just so I could try using mods. The music, design, and story are delightful, the game structure is close to perfect, and playing is overall such a wonderful experience that, if I was possessed by the demon from The Exorcist, you could just show me the SDV startup menu instead of calling a priest.

I highly recommend this game for many reasons, but one of the main ones is the absolute ease of couch co-op built into this game. I wish more games would implement this so people didn't have to download pain in the ass split screen mods just to play in the same room together. \r\nStardew Valley makes co-op play so easy! I can start my game and my boyfriend can join in whenever with a simple click on the controller. He can leave the game whenever and join again without any issues, without affecting my game play. \r\nOutside of that this game is just addictive! I wasn't sure if I'd like it or if I'd find it boring...but I have found myself neglecting my real life chores because I have to get my Stardew chores done. If you enjoy games with clear objectives and tasks to complete you will like this game. There are also things that open up throughout your progression in the game that make you want to keep grinding away at completing those tasks.",

For as long as I've known her she's always been into games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. One day I saw her playing Stardew, and, while I didn't think it would be something I would play on my own at all, I wanted to at least be able to say that I share the same interests. So, I went home that night, dusted off the old Switch, and downloaded Stardew Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] Boy was I wrong... [/b] \r\nOkay, so, hear me out. At FIRST, it really WAS just \"play when gf wants to play,\" but then on my PlayStation I saw that it was on PS+ (and I HATE playing on the Switch but love my PS5) and I HAD TO GET IT. I got it partially because I knew it'd make her happy if I showed that I was interested in one of her favorite games, and also because there was a small part of me that really wanted to give this game an unbiased try for myself on my own time.  So I started a new file, played to like the end of the second week of spring (which is where my girlfriend and I had played to together at the time) and took some time to try to \"find my own way\" in a game. I'm so used to objectives being clearly stated that going around and actually LOOKING for new things to do made it a really nice experience. I played a few times alone, but then started to think, \"Man, I sure do wish this game was on PC. I'd play the crap out of it.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n[b] LOW AND BEHOLD... IT'S ON PC. [/b] \r\n\r\nI didn't want to spend the money without knowing I'd enjoy it for real, so I lowkey did \r\n[spoiler] pirate it [/spoiler], BUT ONLY FOR LIKE A WEEK! Now I'm almost 50 hours deep ALONE THIS TIME and I love it so much. It was such a nice change of pace compared to the other games I play (I'm big into action so all the other games I have also make me whoop ass) that I lowkey might not go back...\r\n\r\nBut, anyways, Stardew Valley: 10/10.",

Nejhorší je ale moje zkušenost s moji bývalou přítelkyní. Byl to den jako každý druhý, všechno super, v noci jsme šli spát na jedné posteli a v tu chvíli se to stalo. Bylo to jako bych se neovládal. Pronikl jsem do mé přítelkyně mojí silnou pěstí podobně jako v Geometry Dash portálem. Cítil jsem se jako bůh když jsem nahmatal čípek. Chytl jsem ho a vytrhl ho ven. V tu chvíli jsem před sebou viděl Level Completed. Moje přítelkyně následně krvácela ale mně to připomělo můj oblíbený level BloodBath. Vlezl jsem do ní úplně celý. Pak jsem se vrátil do normálu, ale bylo už pozdě. Moje přítelkyně to nepřežila a já jsem jí musel sníst.                   Hře proto dávám 2.344/10.",

Another person who hated it as well basically suggested to long rest after every significant fight. Once I adopted this approach, the game worked great for me.\n\nThere are some bad spots in the game (wokeness in some parts for example) but the rest of the game is so great and excellent, it simply outshines the bad parts. The freedom you have in approaching different situations and outcomes are a couple steps above common RPG's. It's a very long game (especially if you like experiencing everything like I did) but it's worth it.",

But when you actually play the game and find out that the ONLY limitation is your imagination, you can't help but think this game is one of (if not THE) best game that's ever been created...",

        "review": "The base gameplay can be very fun when played single player. It's very satisfying to stack gear and get that damage up. However, there are a lot of issues with this game, so I don't recommend playing it in its current state.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer design is abysmal. Quests are not synced between players, meaning if even one person didn't talk to an NPC during a questline, they cannot progress whatsoever. I could understand that the developers want people to experience the story and don't want people rushing each other through, but that doesn't excuse neglecting such an important feature for multiplayer. Also, here's the thing: the story is garbage. It doesn't compel me, and I don't think it will compel many other people. Do not force players to engage with one of the worst aspects of this game.\r\n\r\nHere's a big problem with the story: There's a boss kill stealing issue. You are not allowed to kill any of the act bosses. They either become passive towards you, or get killed by another character. This completely kills the enjoyment of going through the effort of killing one of the dogshit bosses from this game. If my character is the only person who can fight the boss, let me kill the boss god damn it. Don't let some badly written and stupid NPC come in at the end and steal that satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of bosses: They're not fun. The developers have gotten lazy with the boss design and added a bunch of bullshit AOE explosions and other quick large attacks that instant kill the player. My armor is high, my resistance is high, but if I get nicked by one stupid attack, I die. 90% of these bosses attacks do nothing to the me, but suddenly, the boss gets a burst of damage and kills me. I would rather have fewer higher quality bosses that are fair than a lot of bullshit. I would rather die because I chugged heals and ran out like an idiot, rather than get instant killed with some badly telegraphed attack.\r\n\r\nOne last thing: This game's challenge modes are not fun. The Sekema Trials and Chaos Trials are annoying grindy bullshit where the game forces you to take masochistic modifiers to make the game more difficult. This would be fine, if it wasn't imperative for your build to do these trials. Your ascendency progress is directly tied to these modes. Trial of Sekemas specifically is bullshit since you have to prioritize not getting hit, but the stupid developers decided to make all the bosses do AOE explosions and have large health pools. This is a nightmare for melee players. \r\n\r\nI hope these things are changed. They make what would a great game an annoying slog.",

        "review": "I’ve spent a good amount of time with Path of Exile 2, and it’s one of those games that always pulls me back in, even when it pushes me a bit.\r\n\r\nI mainly play Necromancer, and the amount of customization available is honestly impressive. Between skill gems, passives, gear choices, and how minions scale, it constantly feels like I’m shaping my own build rather than following a strict template. Experimenting with different setups is fun, rewarding, and keeps the game feeling fresh every time I return.\r\n\r\nAs someone who isn’t a hardcore ARPG player, I’ll admit the endgame can feel tough. It demands more planning, better gear knowledge, and tighter execution than the early and mid game. That said, it never feels unfair—just challenging. Even when I hit a wall, the depth of the systems makes me want to learn more and try again rather than quit.\r\n\r\nWhat really stands out is how engaging the experience remains overall. The combat feels impactful, progression is meaningful, and the sheer build variety gives the game incredible longevity. Even if I take breaks, I always find myself coming back with a new idea or build in mind.\r\n\r\nPath of Exile 2 strikes a great balance: deep enough to reward dedicated players, but still enjoyable for someone like me who plays at their own pace. Challenging, customizable, and endlessly replayable—it’s a game that sticks with you.",

This is great for making your own specific build but also terrible for someone who's new, therefore it is a massive learning curve.\n\nThe STORY while i've read people seem to think its good , to me its very shallow and I tend to forget what is even going on anymore the further I go into it . This is mainly due to the fact that the story is mainly just some audible conversations and a few animated interactions.\nTHE COMBAT is great, spells are colourful and the combat is really fluent compared to diablo 4. That is the main reason I play this is mainly due to the combat being so much more fluent and fun, boss fights actually seem more action packed and dangerous.\nDLC in this is just skins and extra stash space so it is in no way pay to win . The skins though are overpriced as hell but it makes sense if its the game's main source of income.\nAll in all if you want something more story based and cinematic try diablo 4, if you enjoy combat , levelling and endgame mechanics try this. If the combat was not as good as it is here honestly I would've skipped it.",

I finished act 1 and has almost no clue what and why am I doing.\n\nNevertheless it is more fun to play than Diablo 4 for me because it does not spam you with infinite instantly respawning weak mobs but asks for a carefull smarter approach and time-sensitive attack evasion even with basic enemies. It is more challenging but fun. \n\nEngaging gameplay with good graphics and decent leveling/classes/items system is what makes this game interesting and enjoyable.",

Everyone just uses the killers who oneshot survivors.\n\n3. the game is very buggy. I constantly teleport backwards several feet when droping pallets, which litterly gives the killer a free kill and defeats the whole point of pallets",

        "review": "\nI love Battlefield and always have, I have been playing the games on and off since bf3 launch. So I have experienced all the ups and downs of the franchise as close as I can on a preverbal sideline. I may not be a \"battlefield veteran\" but I have put roughly 600 hours into the franchise over the last decade. So my opinion may not be one of absolute experience but it is one of passion and love for the franchise. \n\nGenerative AI \nIf I knew that Battlefield Studios was/is using gen AI for in-game cosmetics I wouldn't have bought this game in the first place. Sadly I somehow didn't hear about this until after I already bought the game and the season 1 battle pass.\nAI is a blight on the creative industry. It takes away precious work from artists, writers, skilled coders, and basically anyone who would have put love and soul into their work. When AI is used in place of any one of those people it takes away from the soul and human aspect of the product. The decision to push and use AI emphasizes how little EA and the higher ups at Battlefield Studios truly care about the soul of this game. And more importantly it  also shows how little they respect their own employees. As the implementation of AI shows that these execs would rather get something of cheap low quality rather than pay someone that would have produced something of higher quality and have love, care, and passion put into it. The existence of AI in the studio's workflow also creates the side effect of putting the rest of the studio and its passionate teams in the crossfire of peoples debates about its implementation. As more (rightfully) speculative consumers can and [i] will [/i] speculate how much of the final product used AI in the process of its creation. Ultimately diminishing the hard passionate work that real humans put into the game.\n[b] The use of generative AI in Bf6 shows that just like in previous installments, EA and the studio execs are willing to sabotage their studios dignity and public perception for a quick buck. [/b]\n\nWhere's the sandbox?\nBf6 had a glimmer of hope in the beta for being a return to form for battlefield having a fun and engaging sandbox, but just like bf2042, the \"sandbox\" we got at launch has been uninspired and bafflingly balanced. To put it short as sandboxes are temporary, and also steam has a 8000 character limit on reviews, Bf6s sandbox feels like it has dumbed down the class aspect massively to appeal towards a wider audience. Gadgets do little to change the flow of gameplay outside of Defibs and Repair tools which only slow down the flow of gameplay. Grenades feel more of an after thought as none of them really feel good to use and some don’t make sense in their classes kit (Mini-Nades, Incendiary, and Motion Sensor). And all of this seemingly is to be in favor of the most bland weapon sandbox I have seen. All automatic guns seemingly fit into one of three damage classes, which all share the very very very similar damage falloff that I thought for a second they all had the same damage fall off. So ultimately the only thing that makes a gun stand out is it’s rate of fire and if you can mod it to be a laser beam. Which like %50 of the guns can be laser beams. So in the end it isn’t a one weapon dominated sandbox, but it sure feels like it is as every gun feels the same to shoot and be shot with. But unlike Bf4 where this was pretty much the case, Bf6 having three damage classes makes it so a good portion of the sandbox just can’t compete because the only state that matters is rate of fire.\n\nWhat happened to the closed weapon promise?\nI remember seeing the response to them announcing we would be having closed weapons and open weapons as playlists in the months building up to the game. The community was super excited. It was a lot of good karma for the devs. Everyone I played the Beta with agreed that closed weapons playlist felt way better, even those not enfranchised with Battlefield. So why have they quietly stepped back from this?\nI have played both types of playlists a decent amount in my 40 hours of playing and I feel like there isn't a point of even playing the [b]singular[/b] closed weapon playlist most of the time cause it's one half bot filled lobby after another. On top of that they have it on a rotating set of \"attack and defend\" and \"all-out warfare\". What if I just wanted to play conquest with closed weapons? I don't get to if it's \"attack and defend\" or I have to leave the escalation matches to requeue, god forbid I match into a map I dislike playing. I understand it’s not as simple as adding the option to custom search. But Battlefield studios not only needs to do more with closed weapons, but they need to give it the custom search treatment also to actually keep closed weapons on par with open weapons.\n\nThe Maps\nPardon my french but holy cr*p what happened to the maps team, are they okay? It feels like they took all the hard learned lessons from 2042 and drew straws on which maps would remember which lesson. Each map feels like they were designed with only infantry or vehicles in mind, and it feels like an accident if they do work in tandem. Every map feels more like playing a certain aspect of Battlefield as they seemingly were only designed with a wedge of the sandbox in mind. None of these maps feel like they support everything in the sandbox. And the only “lesson” they truly seem to keep across the board was designing all the infantry areas as CQB as possible if it isn’t a sniper lane. Every building feels claustrophobic and choke pointy. Medium range engagements are few and far between, as every lane that opens up seemingly stretches on into sniper distances without much line of sight blockers.\n\nCross-platform\nI want to put forward that I am happy to see Battlefield get such a large influx of players. But jesus christ it feels like they turned up the aim-assist on controllers up to feel familiar to Call of Duty players. Idk if it’s just how weapon sway and aim-assist interact but it feels like a majority of my gunfights against controllers across any distance devolves down to their bullets hitting more consistently. I am not the best aimer in the world, but I know I end up performing above average in other more competitive shooters. Sometimes it feels like I can’t take certain gunfights without having to dip out into cover despite landing the first shots cause I’m fighting a controller player and their laser gun is seemingly lacking bloom compared to my laser gun. I am not saying controllers' aim-assist should see a nerf, but I do think they need to give a pass on how bloom works in this game if they wish to continue with the current sandbox philosophy.\n\nEverytime I get off of Bf6 I sit and think about how EA and Battlefield Studios are once again trying to appeal towards a wider audience with another Battlefield entry. Just like they did with Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Both of them failed horrifically at launch due to their additions and twists to the Battlefield formula and failed to keep a user base as they didn’t appeal to the average battlefield fan or a new audience. Even after over a year of patches to get each game closer to the old battlefields feel, little players returned.\nBut with Bf6 I can’t help but feel like Battlefield Studios has monkey pawed their way into a wider audience. This time instead of adding to the battlefield formula, they have taken it and just simply dumbed it down. Keep it simple stupid. Excellent business strategy for sale to both old and new players. Make an easy to pick up game for new players that is familiar to fans of the franchise. But this new audience is starting to see how shallow the gameplay is. An audience that is leaving from horrible business practices being pushed. And for the returning fans, I think its safe to say most of us are wondering why we shouldn’t go play another battlefield title over this one. As Bf6 may feel like Battlefield, but it sure isn't a fleshed out one",

The rest of it is a toss up on the map and if the people in the aircraft are good. if the map allows for a lot of cover helis are absolutely violent. Sniping isnt fun, as in order to get good you have to practice but since you light up like a tree the moment you have a sniper you get dumped on by everyone its not really a great long range play style anymore, forcing you to run around and quick scope instead of being a sniper. The Netcode is absolutely horrid at the moment as well, dying super fast, dying from a player not looking at you, you shooting several rounds only to get 1 or 3 hit markers even while bursting. Sometimes the game runs really well, and you reg, and its fun to play, sometimes its horrid. Hopefully a big patch comes soon and i can change this review. I would not play it right now if i knew what i know now, i would have waited to buy.",

There is a lot of things to fix but the developers are not fixing them or fixing them incredibly slowly. Content is dry and there is not much to do, maps are small and repetitive.\n\nCore game modes such as Rush are incredibly neglected. There aren't many 'battlefield moments' and doesn't feel like a sandbox shooter as you are forced into many gunfights, challenges and the battlepass dictate your playstyle unlike previous titles. It's upsetting that EA/DICE essentially committed a bait and switch. I do not recommend purchasing this game at full price. It's just a reskinned BF2042... I'd argue BF2042 was a better game after all the fixes and brought a lot more to the table than BF6.",

I get a crash almost every single game in BF6, yet I can play ARC Raiders or similar titles just fine for hours. I highly suggest EA provide an update on their course of action to fix this for their customers and stakeholders. Quality Management. Cheers. \n\n-Penguin\n",

        "review": "I had very high expectations for Battlefield 6. I played it every day because I really wanted to like it, but honestly, the disappointment is just too big.\n\nThe game feels like it’s running at 30 FPS even when I’m clearly above 144 FPS. I tried everything: locking my FPS to 125, changing settings, tweaking my system, testing different configurations… nothing helps. It simply doesn’t feel right when you play. The controls feel heavy, the motion isn’t smooth, and the overall experience is uncomfortable, especially for a fast-paced shooter where fluidity is essential.\n\nWhen a game doesn’t feel right, no amount of technical numbers matters. You immediately notice something is wrong, and it completely breaks immersion. At this point, it’s basically unplayable for me.\n\nWhat makes this even worse is that EA is fully aware of this issue. It has been reported many times by the community, acknowledged, and discussed. Yet, more than four months after the official release, it is still not fixed. That’s honestly a slap in the face to their player base. When people invest their time and money into a game, they expect core problems like this to be treated as a priority.\n\nI’ve done all I could on my side, and it’s clear the problem comes from the game itself, not from my setup. If I had the choice, I would ask for a refund. This feels like a joke on the players, especially considering how long we waited and how much hype there was around this title.\n\nRight now, Battlefield 6 gives me strong “Ubisoft vibes”: big promises, big marketing, and a product that feels unfinished and poorly optimized. For a franchise like Battlefield, that’s honestly unacceptable.",

I paid $45 and still feel iffy about it. \r\n\r\nOne of those games that has a great core gameplay loop (It's Battlefield 4 on a new engine) surrounded by a husk of bad menu design resembling a worse version of MW2019 with battlefield classes and vehichles. \r\n\r\nCampaign is fine, but unremarkable. It's story blends in with every other FPS since 2015.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer is fun for a while before you realize that you can either grind a gun for 6 hours for 2 camos, or you can spend another $12.99 for a skin from the shop. The maps feel samey, there are very little special interactions built into them (i.e. no massive setpiece destructions, no skydiving to the next area of battle, etc.) There's very little sense of reward for the players that paid for the game but dont have an interest in microtransactions. As of writing, opening the game splashes multiple screens urging you to go buy something before you actully get to the menu (gross.) \r\n\r\nHave not tried redsec. Extremely burnt out on extraction and battle royale formats and these don't seem to offer anything that will get me interested. Wishing more dev time was put into Campaign and coherent menu design. Also wishing my $80 game didnt have microtransactions.",

Doesn't allow PC to turn off crossplay so We have to put up with built in cheats and tweens trying to teabag. Although i enjoy reporting them for Sexual harrasment for trying to rub their tiny balls on me. Feels like it was made for console and adapted to PC. SLIDING cut that shit out no need for it in a BF game. Wish it wasn't but kinda feels like a big fuck you to me.",

        "review": "fire game and a great rebound to the old but gold form. \r\nlowkey super grindy sometimes and can be a little annoying with certain aspects but is great to just chill and play as you see fit.\r\nOne BIG gripe tho is the character designs and customization options. I think personally some of the older games benefitted greatly from having their characters being like nobodies that are in the war doing their part and NOT being a distinct type or anything of the sort with things like basic general body shapes like male or female, helmets and masks and clothing that fully covers them or at least obscures what they are underneath so whoever is playing them can then so become them in the war. This game, much like the last game, decided to drop that and for some reason make the models and characters incredibly distinct and very clearly highlighting features like their faces and skin tones which for me personally takes me out of being grounded with the game and ticks me a bit, ESPECIALLY when they lock certain models behind moderately grindy side quests which then forces you to play as whatever character model you dislike and to me that stinks real bad and honestly isn't that big of a deal but like come on bruh\r\n\r\nstill a great game nonetheless",

Purchased the game near release and was surprised on how little content for how large the release of this game was. Maps are horrendous, leveling is abysmal. Takes like 200 hours with a gun to unlock all attachments for it, game does not value your time, EA would rather lock all XP behind battlepasses on a $70 MSRP game. UI is horrific and the microtransactions are thrown in your face when you open the game like its a F2P game. Would return to this game when loads of content are added in with fixes to maps and leveling, otherwise solid foundation so far. Game does have massive potential but feels like a bait and switch so far and not willing to keep playing the game on EA's update cycle right now. Would not recommend purchasing game right now in the state its in, maybe in the future.",

It is not a bad game, I had tons of fun, but still, it wasn't Battlefield.\nNow, when the Beta was release for Battlefield 6, I was dumbfounded. Yes, I'm emotional to the stuff that I love, and I cried when playing it, I cried during the trailers, I was sure Battlefield was back. And when I Pre-Ordered, I was sure this was Battlefield.\nNow imagine my face when I'm happy with Battlefield, or I should say, an EA product that I Pre-Ordered; and this god-forsaken company takes the perfect game they had, and blast it with bots, laughable map design, TERRIBLE matchmaking, and no server-browser.\nNow, that made me sad, sure. But I still played.\nMe: Okay I can like this, it's the new way things are done I guess, I'll get used to it.\nEA: NAH NAH NAH\nAND SHOVED >ADS< FOR IN-GAME PURCHASES IN MY FACE EVERYTIME I OPEN THE GAME.\nOh, also... BATTLE-PASS. The absolute worst Battle-Pass system I've ever seen. \n\"We are giving players the gritty war aesthetic focused skins they want\"\nBAM, NOPE, IT'S BLUE NOW.\nYeah, thanks EA for killing another beloved franchise. I lost all my faith in your company. I loved Battlefield, but oh well, it's dead.\nWish I could keep playing the game I had during the first days and Beta, but no, I can't go back, and I can't reimburse this scam of a game. It's Call of Battlefield now, and I'm done.\nI wish I could tell you how much I want a refund for this game.\n\nReview coming from an avid Battlefield 1942, 2142, 2, 3, 4, 1, and 5 fan. \nI played every battlefield from the clunky 1942 to 2042. I even liked Hardline, Online and of course I loved Heroes.\nNow, am I an expert? Of freaking course not, I'm terrible, but being terrible in any other Battlefield was fun, in this, I feel like I need to give it my all and become a pro, and not have casual fun and relax.",

        "review": "I want to love BF6, I really do. It has some of the most fluid and engaging gameplay I've felt in an fps, ever. At the same time, I keep scratching my head and asking why at seemingly every design decision. Why do I need to slide hop everywhere in order to be effective? Why does the battle pass seem so aggressively anti-player? Why do the maps force me into gunfights multiple times a minute? Why do I seem to react to situations a full second slower than everyone else? Why can I not just breathe and chill playing a fun shooter game? Why can I not even play against bots and at least enjoy the gameplay I spent $70 to experience? I don't get it. I'll probably keep checking in every few weeks to see if something changes, but I think my time playing Battlefield regularly is over.",

I'd say most of the expeirence is 1:1 as the beta. \n\nNet code is terrible, a lot of the shots just dont land, enemies will melt you down in less than a seconds using the same loadout. \n\nMaps are tiny, chaotic as hell, and there is just nothing to do in this game. \n\nI feel like there are 2-3 maps that everyone plays over and over since open beta. There was like 1 map added which is dog shit, and noone enjoys playing that. \n\nAI generated content in the store, instead of adding new maps to play on, no variety. \n\nNetflix interface makes you wanna puke, the only way to search for a match without getting AIDS is through Custom Search\n\nEnemy visibility is hands down the worst it has ever been, its easier to spot enemies in Battlefield 2042, where everyone used hero style operators and had the same player model. \n\nThe game is just in a limbo state atp. Unless they revolutionise the content in season 2 which will probably be released after GTA 6 dont buy this game. \n\nI honestly prefer to play any other battlefield, including battlefield v and 2042 over this.",

But this game can boast its hardcore aspect, from memorizing your teammates’ look, to dying due to sickness from drinking bad water. The most enjoyable part of the game is communication while fighting with enemy survivor or even a group of survivors, without the map and party-maker you have to explain or understand where you saw the enemy last time or located right now. Usually, the names and colors of buildings can be used as a landmarks, but the most interesting part is a possibility of shooting in the woods. This is the time you need to pay attention to different variants of trees and bushes, or the sides of the road and path in the forest. Sometimes you can even rely on the sun and different kinds of ponds, if there is no better way to tell information to your teammate. So, for me the most fun part of the game is surviving in the same world with dozens of other players and knowing that you are never safe.",

        "review": "This game get's a lot of undeserved hate in my opinion. I will say, it does take about 50 hrs or so for it to \"get good\" but even that isn't really true. It just takes about 50hrs to fully take in the game and all of its aspects. My first go around, I got about 40 something hours in and gave up. My 2nd time in however, I gave it a solid go at it and before I knew it, I've spent 120+hrs on just that character alone. And I'm typically what you'd call an \"Alt-o-holic\" where I usually make a ton of alt characters for every scenario or build I can think of. But this game really drew me in.\n\nThey may not have delivered on their promises the way I thought they would, but I'm still very impressed with the game and would say it's worth giving it a shot.",

        "review": "This game has caused me to no longer get my hopes up about any new game i want to play, its not bad per say but its definitely not masterpieces like Fallout 4 and my Fav Skyrim, i bought this game at launch and tried to play it but its just so repetitive, fast travel here, fast travel there, talk to this person, perform this mundane task, persuade this person, etc etc. It wasn't until i recently replayed Fallout 4 which i was not the biggest fan before then that i realized that Fallout 4 is another masterpiece made by Bethesda, before i replayed i thought Skyrim was perfect but after my replay I saw there are things in Fallout 4 that i wish were in Skyrim like the leveling system in Fallout 4. This game should've combined both things that made those games great into one but unfortunately they've missed the mark and its one what i would consider Bethesda's biggest letdowns. Overall id give Starfield a 5/10.\n\nPros\n- Gun play is good\n- movement is great because of the booster pack\n- Ship controls are good \n- Sarah Morgan is my new favourite Bethesda companion \n\nCons\n- Fast Travel is 50 percent of the gameplay\n- Too much dialogue\n- Ship battles are few and far between \n- Research is an unnecessary addition \n- Storages is a joke \n- Houses aren't furnished \"kind of a me gripe\" \n- Most of the storylines are bad beside Ryujin, and Constellation  \n- New Game plus for a Bethesda game doesn't make any sense to me\n- weapons drop off, so if u get and early unique you can make it better unless you've invested in the right perks and done the research which is very time consuming\n",

        "review": "Starfield pushes the boundaries of a Bethesda game forward in its graphics, performance, combat, and concepts in every way, and has the greatest new game plus mechanic I have ever seen in any game before. It is filled with grade 'A' random encounters that can completely impact the entire shape of your game and your story, where each run does feel different. But... Starfield falls unimaginably short in an area no Bethesda game has fallen before. The game is incredibly boring. For every step Starfield takes, and it did take many, there are a dozen more steps in the opposite direction with beloved Bethesda staples I guess I took for granted. Addictive and rich exploration, and a world ripe with characters to fall in love with. Skyrim has the greatest open world exploration in any game. Bethesda's Fallout games have some of my favorite companions in any game ever. But with the rise of writing since 2015's Fallout 4, games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Baldur's Gate 3 have raised the bar for the kinds of stories one should expect from the absolute titan of a legacy Bethesda has earned. The best thing Starfield did for me is inspire me to play Fallout London, which is better and free. Starfield is not worth paying any amount of money and time for, especially not a $70 price tag. \n\nNo stride in technology, innovation in gameplay, or grand narrative is worth a game being empty, boring, and uninspired; a lesson Bethesda should have already known considering that is what makes Skyrim and Fallout 4 timeless classics.",

Too bad other games out classed Starfield so much it didn't even get a pitty nomination at the GoTY awards, by games with genres so niche it's usually a turn-off for folks. maybe this long hiatus will bring something to the table like Cyberpunk's 2.0 update. will probably be like the rest of their games that still struggle without mods, or get broken further. remember, it took microsoft buying bethesda and putting fallout 3 on game pass to fix fallout 3's game for window live DRM that stopped working ages ago. GoG fixed that well before Bethesda did. \n\nSorry Todd, maybe next time don't ignore what works and replace it with loading screens and quests of telephone across the galaxy.",

A lot of the bad reviews are due to the optimization and if you don't have a good rig, it's frame rate will dip a lot. Otherwise this is a very great game!",

The environments are genuinely beautiful — like “I forgot what I was supposed to be doing because that vista looked cool” beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor the few hours I have played at the time of this review, the story and gameplay are solid and actually keep me engaged. Which says a lot in a universe that’s been milked harder than a Bantha on overtime. Combat is serviceable, but, nothing unique, missions are challenging enough, and there seem to be a tonne of side quests when you just wander, (My personal favorite) and overall the game just works well.\r\n\r\nThat said, the controls can be a little janky. Not throw your keyboard or punch your monitor janky, more “why did you climb that instead of the thing directly in front of you?” janky.\r\n\r\nThere are some glitches here and there, but they’re rare and mostly harmless, and the game runs pretty smooth overall.\r\n\r\nBottom line: fun game, great atmosphere, minor hiccups, zero regret(On sale price). If you like Star Wars and want something that doesn’t feel like a reskinned jedi simulator, this is worth your time (and credits).",

The game seems good so far, but I can't help but think it's poorly optimized when it can't even run medium settings low RT on 8GB. It's also pretty CPU intensive; I've seen usage as high as 75% on my 5700X3D when loading. Anyways, I'm enjoying the actual gameplay so far, but in general it doesn't scale well in quality on lower end hardware. I'll update later.",

Wow.\nIn spite of my worst fears, they just got it.\nEven though I consider myself a Star Wars purist, I never cringed at anything they contributed. Wow.\nTrue to the lore, and a storyline that's decently original.\nThey nailed the ambience and atmosphere, and elegantly inserted a few minor cameos here and there, very nicely dosed.\n\nA spark of criticism, I sometimes thought the game a bit repetitive, and it's not really my stick to go look for that one ridge I could climb, but that might just have to do with the kind of game I like to play. Actually, this is not my type, but I was craving for some good ol'e Star Wars petty criminal time and this game is exactly that.\n\nFurthermore:\n- Sabacc is rigged in your favour but fun.\n- Want to sneak through the game? Indulge yourself.\n- Want to blast yourself through the game? Indulge yourself.\n\nWhen getting close to the lategame, you're pretty much a one-woman fortress, but hey what...\nBesides, Death Troopers should know better than letting their yummy guns lying around.",
